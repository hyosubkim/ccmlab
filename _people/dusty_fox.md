I'm a fourth-year student in the Cognitive Systems, Computational Intelligence, and Design where I explore how intelligence, both natural and artificial, is structured and modeled. Before joining Dr. Kim’s lab, I worked as a research assistant with Dr. Nicola Hodges and Dr. Todd Woodward, where I got hands-on experience studying motor and cognitive processes, respectively. Now, in my independent project under Dr. Kim, I’m focusing on modelling movement planning, where I'm interested in exploring how we process and adapt to our environment, and how computational tools can help us model the brain’s internal representations. Outside of academics, I love going on nature walks, spending time with friends, and discovering new music.
